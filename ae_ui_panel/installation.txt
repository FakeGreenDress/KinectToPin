To install, drop the KinectToPin UI.jsx script into your After Effects ScriptUI Panels directory.  By default, this is:

Mac:
/Applications/YOUR AFTER EFFECTS VERSION/Scripts/ScriptUI Panels/

Windows:
C:\Program Files\YOUR AFTER EFFECTS VERSION/Scripts/ScriptUI Panels/

After restarting After Effects, you can access the KinectToPin UI panel from the Window menu, just like your other panels.
